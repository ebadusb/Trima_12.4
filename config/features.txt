#
# 2.) NO SPACES ARE ALLOWED BETWEEN name=value!
#
# 3.) Each entry (or VALUE) is completely specified by SECTION_NAME and NAME.
#     The format for data which is to be seen by the computer is as follows:

[FEATURES]
#
#
#  Each feature is described by the format:
#     feature=enable,CRC
#
#
#  Each line in this section is individually CRCd.  The CRC generated from the
#  feature line must match the given CRC or an error will be given and the
#  Trima machine will generate safe state.  Note that the CRC is based on the
#  actual string used in the setting, not the numeric value.  Thus, the
#  following two sample lines would have different CRC values, although they
#  would result in the same software option selection.  The CRC must be entered
#  as a hex value.
#
#    setting=1
