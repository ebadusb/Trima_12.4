# The following specify the hardware drivers for the Trima

# To enable power fail ridethru, uncomment the following line.  Note
# that this requires proper hardware support.  If power fail ridethru
# is enabled on a system without this hardware support, it may cause a
# system test failure (a timing error will be reported in the safety
# trace log), or it may simply cause power fail recovery to function
# incorrectly (only end run will be available, even if the run should
# have been recoverable).  Note that the system test failure would be
# reported soon after that splash screen is displayed, and so is easy
# to check for.  The only consequence of not enabling power fail
# ridethru on a system with hardware support is that the system will
# not be able to continue running with quite as long an AC power
# glitch (about 40-60 msec shorter than with ridethru enabled).
#
#pfw_ridethru=-R,439c9d97

#
# The following specify the serial port I/O addresses and interrupts
# These may be left blank to use the default settings.
#
# The Versalogic VSBC-6 CPU board requires custom serial port
# interrupts.  The serial_driver command line should be specified as:
#   control_serial_driver=3f8:4 2f8:3 3e8:11 2e8:7,7b30c9d1
#
control_serial_driver=3f8:4 2f8:3 3e8:11 2e8:7,7b30c9d1

#
# The following specify the various network drivers.  These may be
# left blank to use the default settings.
#
# Note that with the upgrade to VxWorks 5.5, these three settings
# are no longer necessary.  However, they remain here so that
# when downgrading back to Trima 5.2 or 5.1, you still have
# connectivity.
