*******************************************************************************

This folder generates an archive library that can be linked
against in order to get strings from the string tables.  It
uses sed in order to convert the string.info files into
source code, and compiles that source code into a binary.

If you want to see how this is used, take a look at the
reason table code or the alarm table code in engineering
tools.  Both make good use of this library.

Because the binary depends on compiles in Trima source code, we
can't just drop in a static executable, because it would defeat
the purpose.  We would have to re-generate that binary each
time a code change was made.  So, the binary must be both
compiled and executed at Trima compile time in order to
incorporate the newest source code.

Thus, there is a need for an external compiler.  I chose g++
since it's free and it's pretty common for other developers
and engineers to have cygwin on their computer.  The makefile
is set up so that if g++ is not in the path, it will fail,
but the build will ignore the failure and continue.

Thus, in order for this all to work, it is necessary to have
Cygwin (or some other Windows implementation of g++) installed,
and in your path.  In order to work correctly, it's a good idea
to have Tornado first in your path, and cygwin last, so that if
there is any overlap, the Tornado utilities are drawn from first.

For example, the path in my build environment looks like this:
PATH=D:\Tornado\host\x86-win32\bin;C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\System32\Wbem;D:\cygwin\bin;
