"""
    USAGE
    1. Save a copy of this file to your computer using the test case ID as the file name (<TestCaseID>.py).
    2. Change the filename in the first line of your document to reflect the name chosen in step 1.
    3. Set the 'scriptName' variable below to be the same as the file name.
    4. Do not edit the "Automated Trima connection" section below.
    5. For each command to be sent to the spoofer, add a "runner.AddCommand" line using the format given in the examples.
    6. If multiple sets of commands need to be executed the runner command cache will need to be reset between command sets by using the runner.ResetCommands() function.
