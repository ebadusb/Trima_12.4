#
#	This file lists the cassettes configured by the
#	administrator.  It is not a comprehensive list.
#	Rather, it represents the subset of REF numbers
#	that will come up in the listbox on the REF
#	number entry screen.
#
#	Each cassette has a 5 or 6 digit REF number and
#	an 8-digit admin code that encrypts the
#	functionality of the cassette. Also, a barcode
#	string is available so that those customers who
#	have a barcode reader available can scan a
#	barcode instead of manually selecting a REF
#	number.
#
#	Cassettes can be added or removed through the
#	machine config screen.  If a REF number exists in
#	both this file and cassette.dat, but with
#	different functionality or barcode listed, this
#	file overrides the other one.
#
#	A list of REF numbers and the sets they are
#	associated with is available from the MDC
#	(part number 377500017).
