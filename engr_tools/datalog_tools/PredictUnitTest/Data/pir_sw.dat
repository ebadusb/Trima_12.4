[FEATURES]
#
#
#  Each feature is described by the format:
#     feature=enable,CRC
#
#  Each feature contains an enable field.  This is a 32-bit value entered
#  in binary (e.g. a value of 10010 has bits 1 and 4 set).  The meaning of
#  each bit is:
#
#    bit0 = enable regardless of language selected
#    bit1 = enable feature if English language is selected
#    bit2 = French
#    bit3 = German
#    bit4 = Italian
#    bit5 = Japanese
#    bit6 = Spanish
#    bit7 = Dutch
#    bit8 = Portuguese
#    bit9 = Swedish
#    bit10 = Korean
#    bit11 = Russian
#    bit12 = Czech
#    bit13 = Chinese
#    bit14 = Polish
#    bits 15-24 reserved future languages
#    bits 25-31 reserved
#
#  Each line in this section is individually CRCd.  The CRC generated from the
#  feature line must match the given CRC or an error will be given and the
#  Trima machine will generate safe state.  Note that the CRC is based on the
#  actual string used in the setting, not the numeric value.  Thus, the
#  following two sample lines would have different CRC values, although they
#  would result in the same software option selection.  The CRC must be entered
#  as a hex value.
#
#    setting=1
#    setting=001
